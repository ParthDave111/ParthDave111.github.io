## COOKS DISTANCE 




This Colab notebook   explores the impact of outliers on linear regression models and demonstrates the use of robust regression techniques and decision trees.

First, it generates a dataset with outliers and fits an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, highlighting the sensitivity of OLS to outliers using Cook's distance.

Then, it compares OLS with Lasso and Huber regression, showing how Huber regression is more robust to outliers.

Finally, it demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Regressor to model the data with outliers.
