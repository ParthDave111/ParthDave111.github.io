I have created a diabetes prediction application using logistic regression to predict weather the person has diabetes or not. 

**Project approach** :Data was collected from Kaggle and EDA was done. During EDA certain outliers excepts from"Insulin" columns were removed for analysis. Insulin sees to be one of the core parameter to judge diabetic condition.
As insulin was higher , some of the column went through standard scaling process . Data was split into train -test in the ratio of 0.3 and logistic regression was applied. Hyperparamter tuning was done using grid search cv to find best parameters for logistic regression. Finally accuracy, precision and recall was calculated.

Python code file :[here](https://github.com/ParthDave111/Diabetes-prediction-Logreg/blob/main/diabetes_prediction_logreg.ipynb)

**Business use case**: When a person get medical report he has to show it to Doctor to get final verdict. He/she can leverage such appplication and can determine if he is diabetic or not. Further this project can also be connected with any IOT apps which monitor certain parameters like glucose, insulin level to notify person to be cautious with sugar intake


## Decision Tree 

In the Decision tree, I have created 2 short project 

Decision Tree Classifier: - Worked on Iris Data set to feature decision tree classifier with post pruning and preprunning
