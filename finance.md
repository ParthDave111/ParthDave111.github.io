## Should you borrow money to invest?

In this project, I have leveraged yfinance to grab data and analyzed time series data for Amazon, Ford and bitcoin

## Copula 
 Copula describes the dependence between multiple variables. Imagine you have data on height and weight. A copula wouldn't tell you how tall or heavy people are, but how those two measures relate to each other

Gaussian:-" It shows data clustered around an average value, with fewer points the further you go from the center. It's commonly used for things like test scores or heights, where most scores fall around the middle.

Student T :-  Similar to Gaussian but with fatter tail. useful when you have smaller datasets, where there's more uncertainty about the true average. It's like the Gaussian, but a little more cautious about making claims until you have more data

Clayton copula describes data where extreme values tend to occur together. Imagine a dataset of house prices. A Clayton Copula might be useful if very expensive and very cheap houses tend to be in the same neighborhoods.

Gumbel copula works differently. It describes data where extreme values tend to exclude each other. Think about flood heights in two different rivers. A Gumbel Copula might be useful if a massive flood in one river makes a flood in the other less likely (because all the rain has already fallen).
